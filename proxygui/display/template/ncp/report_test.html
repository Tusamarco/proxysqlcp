    Summary
    <br />
     
    <br />
    <!--text-->

    <br />

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Kenya is a country with a
    predominantly rural and very young population. About 80% of the
    land area is arid and semi-arid, mainly in the northern and
    eastern regions. Areas with a good agricultural potential
    represent only about 18% of the territory but support 80% of
    the population. Agriculture, mainly rainfed, is the main sector
    of the Kenyan economy. The country is recurrently affected by
    drought, floods and environmental degradation due to
    over-exploitation of natural resources.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Stagnation of food production, an
    unfavourable economic environment and poverty are the major
    causes of food insecurity in the country. Public expenditures
    have declined in the past decade, causing a deterioration of
    infrastructure, education and health services. The persistence
    of malaria and the progression of the HIV/AIDS epidemic have
    contributed to the fall in life expectancy and the rise in
    mortality rates, particularly for infants and under-fives.
    Immunization coverage has also regressed since the 1990's.
    Population groups most affected by these negative trends are
    the rural, the lesser educated, the female-headed households,
    as well as populations living in the arid and semi-arid areas,
    in urban slums and in peri-urban settlements.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">The national dietary energy supply
    barely meets population energy requirements, resulting in
    undernourishment for a third of the population. Nevertheless,
    the prevalence of undernourishment has declined, albeit slowly,
    during the last decade. Although cereals, sugar and vegetable
    oil supply almost two thirds of the dietary energy, the
    diversity of the diet is improving gradually. Supplies of
    fruit, vegetables and milk are increasing.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Some infant feeding practices are
    highly beneficial to the health of children, particularly
    universal breastfeeding, but others such as the low rate of
    exclusive breastfeeding and bottle-feeding are not. Inadequate
    infant feeding practices combined with food insecurity of
    households and low access to health services lead to a high
    prevalence of undernutrition among young children, particularly
    in the North Eastern, Eastern and Coastal provinces. Overall,
    during the last decade, prevalence of underweight, stunting and
    wasting have not declined. Women are also affected by chronic
    energy deficiency. While undernutrition persists at high
    levels, overnutrition is emerging among urban adults.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Undernutrition is associated with
    widespread micronutrient deficiencies. Although recent data are
    not available, it is likely that iodine deficiency disorders
    are still prevalent. The national programme of iodization of
    salt needs to be evaluated. Vitamin A deficiency and iron
    deficiency anemia are both highly prevalent in the country. The
    implementation of supplementation in vitamin A and iron is
    still insufficient. More long-term strategies are needed such
    as fortification, dietary diversification and nutritional
    education.

    <!--text-->

    <br />
     

    <p
     class="NCP_text NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Situated in East Africa, Kenya is
    bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, Ethiopia
    to the north, Sudan to the north-west, Somalia to the east, and
    the Indian Ocean to the south-east. Its area is approximately
    of 584 000 km2, divided into 8 provinces and 72 districts. The
    coastline and the port in Mombasa enable the country to trade
    easily with other countries. The country falls into two
    regions: lowlands, including coastal and lake basin lowlands,
    and highlands, which extend on both sides of the Great Rift
    Valley. Approximately 80% of the land area of the country is
    arid or semiarid.</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Kenya has climatic and ecological
    extremes with altitude varying from sea level to over 5000 m in
    the highlands, in the south-eastern part of the country.
    Rainfall and temperatures are influenced by altitude and
    proximity to lakes or the ocean. The mean annual rainfall
    ranges from less than 250 mm in semi-arid and arid areas to
    more then 2000 mm in areas with high agricultural potential
    (FAO, Forestry Division).</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text">There are four seasons in the year: a dry
    period from January to March, the long rainy season from March
    to May, followed by a long dry spell from May to October and
    the short rains between October and December. The country is
    disaster-prone, experiencing droughts and floods. The arid and
    semi-arid lands in the northern part of the country are the
    most affected by droughts (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004; WFP,
    2005a).</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify"><span
     class="NCP_text">The population is comprised of about 42
    ethnic groups. Major tribes include the Kikuyu, Luo, Kalenjin,
    Luhya, Kamba, Kisii, Mijikenda, Somali, and Meru. English is
    the official language while Kiswahili is the national language
    (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</span></p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Kenya's population is young, and
    still predominantly rural despite rural-urban migration. Annual
    population growth rate declined from 3.4% in 1969-1989 to 2.9%
    in 1989-1999, and is now estimated at 2.2%. This trend is due
    to a decline in fertility rates since the mid-1980s and is the
    result of efforts deployed in the framework of the National
    Population Policy for Sustainable Development (NCPD, 2000).
    Mortality rates have increased since the 1980s, presumably due
    to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, deterioration of health services, and
    widespread poverty (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</p>

    <p
     class="MsoNormal"
     style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify">Although its
    share in the GDP is declining (from 23% in 1999 to 16% in
    2003), agriculture remains a major sector for the Kenyan
    economy (WB, World Development Indicators Database). About 74%
    of the economically active population works in agriculture, and
    of these about 80% are smallholders. Agriculture in Kenya is
    predominantly rain fed (FAO, 2005). Coffee, tea, and
    horticulture (flowers, fruits, and vegetables) are the main
    agricultural export commodities; in 2002, the three commodities
    accounted for 53% of total export earnings (CBS, 2003).</p>

    <p
     class="MsoNormal"
     style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify"><span>About 18% of the land area
    is high to medium potential agricultural land, and supports 80%
    of the population. The remaining 20% of the population lives in
    the remaining 80% of the land which is arid and semi-arid, and
    characterized by low, unreliable and poorly distributed
    rainfall. These areas are used for pastoral farming (UN &amp;
    MPND, 2003; FAO, Country Pasture/Forage Resource
    Profiles).&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Widespread poverty in rural areas
    leads to over-exploitation of natural resources. Uncontrolled
    forest logging and unsustainable agriculture are reducing the
    vegetal capital stock and decreasing the water retention
    capacity of the soil and are causing increased erosion (UN
    &amp; MPND, 2003; FAO,&nbsp;Country&nbsp;Pasture/Forage
    Resource Profiles). Agricultural productivity is also affected
    negatively by a land tenure system that encourages uncontrolled
    fragmentation of land into small uneconomic production units
    (EC &amp; FIVIMS, 2004).</p>

    <p

     style="text-align: justify">Fish consumption varies
    considerably between different geographical regions and
    population groups within the country. It is highest in the

    fisheries) and in the major towns, and lowest in traditionally
    pastoral areas in the north and parts of the Rift Valley (FAO,
    2001).</p>

    tourism is a sector of major economic importance (CBS, MOH

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">In the 1960's, after Kenya's
    independence, the economy grew by about&nbsp;7% annually,
    thanks to good performances of both the manufacturing sector
    and agricultural production. Since the 1970's, there has been a
    consistent decline in the economy, reaching the lowest annual
    GDP growth level of about 2% between 1996 and 2002. Growth of
    GDP has failed to keep pace with population growth. The weak
    performance of the economy has been due to external shocks and
    internal structural problems, including the drought of the
    1980s, low commodity prices, world recession, bad weather, poor
    governance and inadequate infrastructure (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC
    Macro, 2004; IMF, 2005).</p>

     style="text-align: justify">Kenya's export basket mainly
    comprises agricultural commodities, while manufactured products
    account for less than 40% of total exports. Non-food imports
    are constituted mainly by petrol (16%), chemicals (14%),
    machinery and transport equipment (32%) and other manufactured
    goods (16%) (IMF, 2005).</p>

    rates are stagnating or increasing, from 73&permil; and
    105&permil; respectively in 1989-1993 to 77&permil; and
    115&permil; in 2003. The under-five mortality rate is higher in
    rural areas. The rates vary greatly by province, and according
    to mothers' level of education. Except for neonatal mortality,
    all childhood mortality indicators were highest in Nyanza
    Province and lowest in the Central Province (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC
    Macro, 2004). Childhood vaccination coverage has also
    deteriorated, with a fall of the proportion of children aged
    12-23 months fully vaccinated from 79% in 1993 to 52% in 2003
    (IMF,&nbsp;2005). The level of maternal mortality is very high
    (UN &amp; MPND, 2003).</p>

     style="text-align: justify">The HIV/AIDS pandemic has
    compounded the deteriorating health standards, particularly in
    urban areas, in Nairobi and also in the Nyanza Province. The
    pandemic has caused a steep rise in the number of orphans,
    growing destitution, and unprecedented levels of poverty.
    Malaria also remains a major health problem in Kenya, with both
    health and economic consequences such as loss of income and
    incapacity to work (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</p>

    1989, 1993 and 1998 show that there has been no improvement in
    access to improved water sources in the past decade. Most of
    the rural population still uses only unprotected wells, springs
    and boreholes (UN &amp; MPND, 2003). Concerning data on access
    to sanitation (see table below), access to improved sanitation
    is underestimated as simple or traditional pit latrines were
    not classified as improved sanitation in urban areas (UN &amp;
    MPND, 2003).</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">There has been a general decline
    in the country's provision of health services, due to the
    increasing burden of disease and poor performance of the
    economy coupled with demographic pressure. This decline has
    been reflected by diminishing per capita allocations for health
    over the years (UN&nbsp;&amp;MPND,&nbsp;2003), and by a slight
    decrease in pregnant women's access to antenatal care since
    1998, both in terms of quantity and quality (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC
    Macro, 2004).</p>

    from 80% in 1990 (UN &amp; MPND, 2003) to 66% in 2003 (UNESCO,
    2004). This was due to several factors, among others, Kenya's
    previous cost-sharing policy and differential geographic access
    to educational facilities (UN &amp; MPND, 2003). The negative
    trend in enrolment and retention is likely to be reversed as
    the Government of Kenya has now introduced free primary
    education. It is estimated that the goal of universal primary
    education will be achieved by the year 2015 (UN &amp; MPND,
    2003). There are no gender differences in rates of enrolment,
    retention and completion at primary and secondary levels in
    Kenya.</p>

    Kenya are the following: a rural location, a large size of
    households, low levels of education of heads of households,
    female headed households, subsistence farming, low access to
    land, lack of ownership of livestock and lack of durable farm
    tools.</p>

    <p

    proportion of the population living below the national poverty
    line has risen from about 49% in 1990, to 55% in 2001, and up
    to 56% in 2003. Unemployment has also increased, affecting 15%
    of the labour force in 2003 (EC &amp; FIVIMS, 2004). Three
    quarters of the poor live in rural areas. The urban poor live
    in slum and peri-urban settlements (IMF, 2005).</p>

     style="text-align: justify">Maize is the basic staple of the
    Kenyan diet. Ugali, the main dish, is a thick porridge of maize
    meal that is usually eaten with a sauce of vegetables or meat,
    or simply accompanied with fermented milk. Dishes of boiled
    maize and beans (githeri) and maize, beans, vegetables and
    potatoes (irio) are also common. Mashed plantain (matoke) is an
    alternative to maize. Other staples are cassava and sweet
    potatoes, and rice in urban areas. Milk and dairy products are
    an important part of the diet, in all parts of the country, but
    especially in pastoral communities. Both fresh and fermented
    milk are consumed.<span

    <br />

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Food security is defined as "A
    situation that exists when all people, at all times, have
    physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and
    nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food
    preferences for an active and healthy life" (FIVIMS). Food
    insecurity may be caused by the unavailability of food,
    insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate distribution, or
    inadequate use of food at the household level. Food insecurity
    may be chronic, seasonal or transitory.</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Kenya is a low-income food-deficit
    country (WFP, 2005a). In 2004, it was estimated that more than
    10 million Kenyans were experiencing chronic hunger, with only
    a small decline in absolute numbers over the ten-year period
    ending in 2002. This represents approximately a third of
    Kenya's total population. Food insecurity in Kenya is often
    seen as a problem of availability of food because of the poor
    performance of the agricultural sector, but problems of access
    to food also play an important role, because of inadequate
    market and transport infrastructure and low income and
    purchasing power due to poverty. Seasonal food insecurity
    affects households in rural areas before the start of the
    harvest. In addition to problems of chronic and seasonal food
    insecurity, Kenya is plagued by acute food insecurity primarily
    due to droughts and/or floods, which threaten lives and
    livelihoods of the most vulnerable groups of the population,
    particularly in the semi-arid and arid regions (EC &amp;
    FIVIMS, 2004). An assessment conducted in July 2005 by the
    Government of Kenya and the World Food Programme indicated that
    there has been significant deterioration in household food
    security in most parts of north-eastern Kenya (Wajir, Garissa
    and Tana River districts) and in farming households in the
    south-eastern and coastal marginal districts (WFP, 2005b).</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Agriculture which remains the
    backbone of the economy declined. As a sector that engages over
    74% of the country's labour force, such a decline implies lower
    levels of income and more importantly, less food for the vast
    majority of Kenyans. Agricultural productivity is also affected
    negatively by fragmentation of land holdings (EC &amp; FIVIMS,
    2004).</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Poor marketing and trade
    infrastructures adversely affect producers' access to both
    inputs and to markets for selling their products. The livestock
    sector is also affected by poor market infrastructure and
    inadequate quality control (EC &amp; FIVIMS, 2004).</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">The food insecurity and
    vulnerability problems in the country are compounded by high
    levels of poverty. An estimated 17 million people (56% of the
    population), of whom three-quarters are found in rural areas,
    are living below the poverty line. The Kenyan economy has
    performed poorly during the last two decades. Consequently, per
    capita income has declined, and unemployment has risen (IMF,
    2005).</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">In cities, the progression of the
    HIV/AIDS epidemic is also a major cause of poverty and food
    insecurity, killing active adults, devastating families and
    increasing the number of orphans.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">In terms of supply for human
    consumption, the three major food groups are cereals, fruit and
    vegetables and milk and eggs.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Overall, during the period 1965/67
    to 2000/02, the supplies of cereals and starchy roots have
    declined while that of fruit and vegetables, milk and eggs,
    vegetable oils and sweeteners have increased.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">The per capita supply of cereals
    fell from 408g/day in 1965/67 to 326g/day in 2000/02. A series
    of droughts occurred in 1993, 1996 and from mid-1999 to
    mid-2002 causing important shortcomings in cereal production.
    Maize and wheat are the main components of the supply of
    cereals. Maize is essentially locally produced while 70% of
    wheat was imported in 2002 (FAO, FAOSTAT Database). Maize
    production has decreased due to recurrent droughts. As a
    result, maize prices increased with severe consequences on
    household food security because this food is the main staple.
    The supply of starchy roots, mainly potatoes and cassava
    locally produced, decreased from 214g/per capita/day in 1965/67
    to 152g/per capita/day in 2000/02.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">The per capita supply of fruit and
    vegetables has steadily increased, from 165g/day to 255g/day in
    1965/67 and 2000/02 respectively. The supply of fruit is
    principally composed of plantains, pineapples and bananas,
    which are locally produced (FAO, FAOSTAT Database).&nbsp;</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">The supply of animal products has
    fluctuated. The per capita supply of milk and eggs slightly
    decreased in a first period from 1965/67 to 1979/81 and then
    increased considerably in 1986/88 (to 260g/day). During the
    following period, supply remained over 200g/per capita/day. The
    supply of meat and offals (principally bovine meat) slightly
    decreased from 52g/per capita/day in 1965/67 to 46g/per
    capita/day in 2000/02, while the supply of fish increased.
    Supply of animal fats remained stable.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">The supply of vegetable oils
    (particularly refined palm oil) has increased five-fold between
    1965/67 and 2000/02 and the supply of sweeteners increased by
    half during the same period (FAO, FAOSTAT Database). Trends in
    the supply of these two foods groups (vegetable oils and
    sweeteners) could be partially responsible for the emergent
    phenomenon of nutrition transition that affects certain
    population groups.</p>

    population energy requirements of 2 095 kcal/per capita/day
    [note1]. This implies that, due to inequality of distribution
    of the DES in the country, a large part of the population
    cannot satisfy their energy requirements. In 2000/02, according
    to "The State of Food Insecurity in the World" (SOFI), the
    prevalence of undernourishment was 33%, which represents a
    reduction by 11 percentage points over a decade (FAO,

    supply of cereals, fruit and vegetables, pulses, vegetable oil
    and starchy roots, the share of macronutrient of vegetable
    origin is important. In 2000-02, 88% of energy was from
    vegetable foods. For protein and lipid supplies, 72% and 67%
    were of vegetable origin respectively. Limited supplies of
    animal products imply low intakes and low bioavailability of
    iron, vitamin A and calcium.</span>

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Breastfeeding is a common practice
    in Kenya, as the large majority (97%) of children under 5 years
    were breastfed. This proportion has not varied between 1993 and
    1998 (CBS, NCPD, &amp; Macro Int., 1999; CBS, MOH &amp; ORC
    Macro, 2004). Breastfeeding is equally widespread in urban and
    rural areas but was less common in the North Eastern province
    (89%).</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify"><span
     class="NCP_text">Early initiation of breastfeeding is also
    largely practiced; more than half of neonates were breastfed
    within one hour of birth and 82% within one day after delivery
    (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004). Duration of breastfeeding
    does not vary by urban/rural sector, and education only has a
    modest influence, uneducated mothers breastfeeding for about 4
    months more than educated mothers (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro,
    2004).</span><span

    <p
     class="NCP_text NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Infant and young child feeding
    practices are rather favourable to health and growth. However,
    there are still some inadequate practices particularly
    regarding exclusive breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. Only 29%
    of children under 2 months of age were exclusively breastfed.
    After 2 months, the percentage decreased sharply and overall
    only 13% of children under 6 months were exclusively breastfed.
    Bottle-feeding is a rather common practice in Kenya, concerning
    more than one-quarter of children under 1 year (CBS, MOH &amp;
    ORC Macro, 2004). Bottle-feeding may result in increased
    morbidity due to unsafe preparation techniques and because a
    large proportion of the population do not have access to
    improved water sources (UNICEF, 2005).</p>

     style="text-align: justify"><span
     class="NCP_text">The timing of the introduction of
    complementary feeding is generally adequate (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC

    amounts given are not documented.</span><span

     class="NCP_text">In 1998, the prevalence of low birth weight
    (less than 2 500g) was of 11%, but only 46% of neonates had
    been weighed (UNICEF &amp; WHO, 2004; UNICEF, Information by
    country). Thus the representativeness of the indicator is
    limited. The high prevalence of low birth weight could be
    related to the prevalence of chronic energy deficiency among
    mothers (12%) (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</span><span

    <br />

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Three national surveys, conducted
    in 1998, 2000 and 2003 document the nutritional status of
    preschool children (CBS, NCDP &amp; Macro Int., 1999; CBS &amp;
    MFP, 2002; CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">In 2003, 20% of children under 5
    years were underweight and the prevalence of severe underweight
    was 4%.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Almost a third of children were
    stunted, and 11% were severely stunted. The prevalence of
    stunting was higher among male children then among females, and
    higher in rural compared to urban areas. The Eastern and Coast
    provinces had the highest prevalence of stunting. The
    prevalence in the arid and poor North-Eastern province is lower
    than expected but this could be due to the small size of the
    sample or problems with measurements. Prevalence of stunting
    was much lower among mothers with secondary and higher
    education (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">The survey was conducted during
    the period of food shortage. Wasting affected 6% of preschool
    children and 1% were severely wasted. Prevalence was highest in
    the 12-23 months age group, when contaminated complementary
    foods are introduced and are likely to cause diarrhea. The
    prevalence of wasting among children in the North-Eastern
    province was extraordinarily high (27%) and prevalence of
    severe wasting was very high (11%) (CBS, MOH and ORC Macro,
    2004). These levels of wasting in underfives indicate a major
    food crisis. This province is often affected by food deficits.
    In 2003, harvests were delayed in many regions, including the
    North-Eastern province, and the maize supply did not meet
    consumption needs during the critical July-September period
    (FEWS, 2003). The data from this province must nevertheless be
    interpreted with caution because of the small size of the
    sample and possible problems of validity as stunting prevalence
    was simultaneously unexpectedly low.</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Overall a small proportion of
    underfives were overweight. Although the figures are low,
    prevalence in the urban sector is twice that found in rural
    areas suggesting that overnutrition of young children could be
    an emerging phenomenon in urban Kenya (CBS, MOH and ORC Macro,
    2004).<span
     style="color: #000000"></span></p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify">Analysis of trends across the
    three surveys shows that prevalence of underweight and stunting
    did not decrease substantially between 1998 and 2003. Moreover,
    the prevalence of wasting remained the same (CBS, NCDP &amp;
    Macro Int., 1999; CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004). These
    results show that there has been no progress in the nutrition
    situation of infants and young children in the last 5 years,
    which reflects unfavourable trends in several sectors, e.g.
    stagnation of the economy and of the food security situation,
    persistent lack of access to health care and affordable drugs,
    and the progression of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>

    were stunted (height &lt;1.45m), but more than one out of ten
    (12%) had a body mass index &lt;18.5kg/m&sup2;, defining
    chronic energy deficiency (CED). Prevalence of CED was highest
    among young women aged 15-19 years, reaching 20%. Women living
    in rural areas were much more likely to have CED than urban
    women (15% and 5% respectively). Food deficits are common in
    the North-Eastern province and this affected the nutritional
    status of women living in this area. There is an inverse
    relationship between educational level and CED: only 6% of
    women with secondary or higher education level were affected
    (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</p>

    <p
     class="NCP_text NCP_text"

    Int, 1999; CBS, MOH and ORC Macro, 2004). In comparison with
    data from 1993, the nutritional status of women worsened
    slightly, with prevalence increasing from 9% to 12% according
    the most recent survey (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004).</p>

    <p
     style="text-align: justify"><span
     class="NCP_text">In 2003, almost one-quarter of women were
    overweight or obese. A positive trend was observed with
    advancing age. Prevalence of overweight and obesity were much
    higher in the urban sector (38% vs only 18% in the rural
    sector) (CBS, MOH &amp; ORC Macro, 2004). Estimates taken from
    the SuRF report are similar (WHO, 2005). The representativeness
    of the data is however not documented. The data suggest that
    the urban population of Kenya is starting to be affected by the
    nutrition transition.</span></p>

    Moreover, even when available, the cost of meat often limits
    its consumption by low-income households. Parasitic diseases,
    including malaria, also contribute to IDA (UNSTAT, Millennium
    Indicators Database).</span><span

    II.7. Policies and programmes aiming to improve nutrition and
    food security
    <br />
    <!--text-->

    <br />
     

    <p
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">Kenya first developed a Food
    Policy in 1981 with the major objective to support
    self-sufficiency in major foodstuffs and ensure equitable
    distribution of food of good nutritional value to the
    population. A review of this policy reinforced this objective
    in 1994. Following economic reforms and because of persistent
    poverty and hunger, a policy review addressing wider concerns
    of underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, and
    calling for action is long overdue (ROK, 2004).</p>

    <div
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">
      Currently, a review of the National Food and Nutrition Policy
      (NFNP) is being implemented. The NFNP should provide an
      enabling environment in which everyone has access to food
      through production or purchase. Past policies have failed to
      make the country food secure. A revised NFNP will propose
      measures to prevent and limit the negative impact of drought
      (e.g. through improved soil and water management). The new
      NFNP will also draw on international standards and policy
      statements, such as those elaborated by the International
      Conference on Nutrition (1992), the World Food Summit (1996),
      and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (ROK, 2004).
    </div>

    <div
     style="text-align: justify">
      <p
       class="NCP_text"
       style="text-align: justify">The government put in place the
      Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment (ERS). A
      key objective of the ERS is to ensure food security. There
      are a number of well-defined goals and targets that the
      Government subscribes to in support of the reduction in
      poverty and hunger and for achieving food and nutrition
      security (ROK, 2004).</p>
      <span
       class="NCP_text">The Kenyan Coalition for Action in
      Nutrition (KCAN) held its first National Nutrition Congress
      in Nairobi in February 2005 and focused on various issues and
      strategies needed to deal with nutrition problems in Kenya.
      It provided a forum for discussion on diverse issues in
      nutrition ranging from research, policy and programs. The
      Ministry of Health reinforced the number of competent
      professionals in nutrition, realizing that diet, in most
      cases, is the first step in disease management. It is
      actually an indication that government is waking up, albeit
      late, to begin appreciating the need to focus on preventive
      rather than just curative measures. To enhance food and
      nutrition security, the Rural Outreach Program (ROP) is
      involved in spearheading a biodiversity campaign. This
      encourages the utilization of indigenous plant resources by
      enhancing their production and availability. The focus is
      mainly on leafy vegetables among low-income groups as a
      source of micronutrient and income (Oniang'o, 2005).</span>
    </div>

    <div
     class="NCP_text"
     style="text-align: justify">
      A review of nutrition information systems conducted by UNICEF
      and Save the Children-UK in 2004 concluded that there is need
      for improved methods of collecting and disseminating
      nutritional data for improved planning and programming.
      Moreover, there is a need to strengthen the integration of
      nutrition data with other types of information such as food
      security and poverty descriptors. The development of
      effective nutrition information systems in Kenya is a key
      strategy of the draft national food security and nutrition
      policy currently being developed by the Food and Nutrition
      Policy Unit and the Inter-ministerial Co-ordinating Committee
      on Food and Nutrition (ICCFN) (ROK, 2004).
